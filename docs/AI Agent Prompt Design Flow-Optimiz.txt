 AI Agent Prompt: Design Flow-Optimized Task Templates for Productivity Application

  Context & Objective

  You are designing task templates for "Ultron," a productivity management application that
  emphasizes flow state optimization and anti-procrastination principles. The current templates are      
  generic and don't leverage flow-based psychology. Your goal is to create 12-15 highly specific,        
  flow-optimized task templates that help users achieve "buttery execution" by addressing the
  neurochemical "civil war" between approach and avoidance systems.

  Core Flow-State Principles to Integrate

  1. 4% Challenge Sweet Spot - Tasks should be challenging enough to engage but not overwhelm
  2. Micro-Goals - Break tasks into "ridiculously specific" steps that eliminate mental resistance       
  3. Minimum Flow Blocks - Focus on uninterrupted time needed rather than total duration
  4. Engagement Strategies - Address the critical "engage" phase before struggle begins
  5. Energy Level Matching - Align task cognitive load with optimal energy states
  6. Procrastination vs Ambivalence - Help users distinguish between resistance types

  Template Structure Requirements

  Each template must include:

  {
    id: string; // kebab-case, descriptive
    name: string; // Emoji + clear name (e.g., "üî¨ Research Deep Dive")
    description: string; // 1-2 sentences describing the template's purpose
    context: string; // 2-3 sentences with flow-optimized context and approach
    priority: TaskPriority; // low, medium, high, urgent
    estimated_hours: number; // Realistic time estimate (0.5-8 hours)
    tags: string[]; // 3-5 relevant tags
    project_context?: ProjectContext; // business or personal

    // NEW FLOW-BASED FIELDS:
    microGoals: string; // Pre-written micro-steps that eliminate resistance
    challengeLevel: number; // 1-10 scale (4-6 is optimal flow zone)
    engagementStrategy: string; // sleep-to-flow, lower-hurdle, time-constraint, response-inhibition     
    minimumFlowHours: number; // Minimum uninterrupted time for effective flow
    minimumFlowMinutes: number; // Additional minutes (0, 15, 30, 45)
    energyLevel: number; // 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high energy required
    procrastinationTips: string; // Specific advice for this task type
  }

  Target User Personas

  1. Therapist/Counselor - Progress notes, session prep, documentation, compliance
  2. Director of Operations - maintenance, installations, writing procedures, planning, collaborations, meetings
  3. IT - admin, connections, installations, updates, fixing problems
  4. Business Professional - Presentations, analysis, client communication, strategic planning
  5. Developer/Technical - Code reviews, debugging, feature implementation, system integration
  6. Creative Professional - Design work, content creation, ideation, prototyping
  7. Project Manager - Planning, stakeholder management, process optimization, reporting

  Template Categories to Cover (3-4 templates each)

  1. Deep Work Templates (High cognitive load, flow-critical)

  - Complex analysis tasks
  - Strategic planning and ideation
  - Technical implementation work
  - Creative design and problem-solving

  2. Communication Templates (Medium cognitive load, relationship-critical)

  - Client presentations and updates
  - Team collaboration and feedback
  - Stakeholder management
  - Documentation and knowledge transfer

  3. Administrative Templates (Low-medium cognitive load, process-critical)

  - Compliance and regulatory tasks
  - Process documentation and improvement
  - Data entry and organization
  - Routine maintenance and updates

  4. Learning Templates (Variable cognitive load, growth-critical)

  - Skill development and training
  - Research and investigation
  - Best practice analysis
  - Professional development

  Flow Optimization Guidelines

  Micro-Goals Examples:

  ‚ùå Bad: "Complete market research"
  ‚úÖ Good: "1. Open competitor analysis spreadsheet\n2. Navigate to Company A's pricing page\n3.
  Record 3 pricing tiers in cell B2-B4\n4. Screenshot pricing table\n5. Repeat for Companies B-E"        

  Challenge Level Calibration:

  - Level 1-3: Boredom risk - Routine, automated tasks
  - Level 4-6: Flow sweet spot - Optimal challenge-skill balance
  - Level 7-10: Anxiety risk - Overwhelming complexity

  Engagement Strategy Selection:

  - Sleep-to-Flow: Morning tasks, within 60 seconds of waking
  - Lower-Hurdle: Start with easiest version to build momentum
  - Time-Constraint: Artificial deadline pressure for motivation
  - Response-Inhibition: Commit before overthinking can sabotage

  Energy Level Matching:

  - Level 1: Administrative, routine tasks, email processing
  - Level 2: Planning, documentation, moderate analysis
  - Level 3: Complex problem-solving, creative work, strategic thinking

  Industry-Specific Requirements

  Healthcare/Therapy Context:

  - HIPAA compliance considerations
  - Evidence-based practice requirements
  - Client safety and ethical guidelines
  - Professional development standards

  Business/Corporate Context:

  - ROI and business impact focus
  - Stakeholder communication needs
  - Process efficiency optimization
  - Strategic alignment requirements

  Technical/Development Context:

  - Code quality and best practices
  - Security and performance considerations
  - Documentation and knowledge transfer
  - Testing and validation processes

  Success Criteria

  Your templates should:
  1. Eliminate "blank page" syndrome - Clear starting points and next steps
  2. Reduce decision fatigue - Pre-optimized settings for common scenarios
  3. Address common procrastination triggers - Built-in resistance management
  4. Scale across experience levels - Useful for beginners and experts
  5. Feel immediately actionable - Users can start within 60 seconds

  Output Format

  Provide exactly 12-15 templates in TypeScript format, organized by category. Include detailed
  comments explaining the flow-optimization rationale for each template's settings.

  Focus on practical, real-world scenarios that your target users face daily, with emphasis on tasks     
   that commonly trigger procrastination or require sustained focus. Each template should feel like      
  a "cheat code" for achieving flow state in that specific type of work.
