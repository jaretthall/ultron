# Google Gemini API Removal Summary

## Overview
Google Gemini API access has been removed from the Ultron application. The application now uses Claude or OpenAI as the primary AI providers.

## Changes Made

### 1. **AI Service Layer** (`src/services/aiService.ts`)
- Removed Gemini import statements
- Removed Gemini from `PROVIDER_FAILOVER_ORDER` (now: `['claude', 'openai']`)
- Removed Gemini case from `checkProviderAvailability` function
- Removed all Gemini switch cases in AI service methods
- Kept Gemini types for backward compatibility only

### 2. **Settings Page** (`src/components/settings/SettingsPage.tsx`)
- Changed default AI provider from `'gemini'` to `'claude'`
- Removed "Google Gemini" option from AI provider dropdown
- Removed entire Gemini configuration section (API key display, model selection)
- Auto-migrates users with Gemini to Claude

### 3. **Type Definitions** (`types.ts`)
- Updated `AIProvider` type comment to mark Gemini as deprecated
- Kept Gemini in type union for backward compatibility

### 4. **Build Configuration** (`vite.config.ts`)
- Removed `html-env-inject` plugin that injected Gemini API key
- Removed Gemini API key definitions from `define` section
- Removed `@google/genai` from manual chunks configuration

### 5. **HTML Entry Point** (`index.html`)
- Removed Gemini API key placeholder
- Removed `@google/genai` from import map

### 6. **Package Dependencies** (`package.json`)
- Removed `@google/genai` dependency

### 7. **Database Service** (`services/databaseService.ts`)
- Changed default AI provider from `'gemini'` to `'claude'`
- Added auto-migration logic for users with Gemini preference

### 8. **Database Fix** (`fix-notes-lists-schema.sql`)
- Fixed notes and shopping lists tables to use `public.users` instead of `auth.users`
- Updated RLS policies for custom authentication compatibility

## Migration Path for Users

1. **Existing Users with Gemini**: Automatically migrated to Claude
2. **API Keys**: Users need to provide Claude or OpenAI API keys
3. **No Action Required**: The migration is automatic

## Remaining Files
- `src/services/geminiService.ts` - Can be deleted but kept for type exports
- Various documentation and archive files mentioning Gemini - Can be cleaned up later

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
2. Run the `fix-notes-lists-schema.sql` script to fix database issues
3. Test AI functionality with Claude or OpenAI
4. Consider removing `src/services/geminiService.ts` after verifying no type dependencies

## Notes
- Gemini service file is kept temporarily for type exports (DailyPlan, WorkloadAnalysis)
- These types should be moved to a shared types file in future refactoring
- All Gemini functionality has been successfully removed from active code paths
